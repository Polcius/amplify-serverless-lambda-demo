# AWS Amplify + Serverless Demo

## Introduction

Small project to learn how to integrate AWS Amplify + Serverless lambdas in a VueJS environment. Following [these steps](https://read.acloud.guru/serverless-functions-in-depth-507439b4be88).

## Requirements

You will need the [Amplify CLI](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli-toolchain/quickstart) installed globally _with NPM_. Using Yarn gives an error in the setup (as of Dec. 2019).

This uses the [Shiba.Online API](https://shibe.online/), but feel free to use another one of your choice. This is meant to be a boilerplate/demo only.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
